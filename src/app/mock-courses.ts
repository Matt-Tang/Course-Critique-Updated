    review: 'What an interesting course. This was the first Chemical Engineering related course I took. In terms of course content I already forgot most of the concepts but I will always remember process flow and equilibrium. CHE 100 does not require heavy mathematical skills nor extensive knowledge of chemical knowledge. Instead it requires understanding mass balance, mol balance, and controlling inputs and outputs. In terms of teaching, the department decided to take a unique approach. Instead of one professor they had 2 professor (Professor Boxin Zhao and Professor Michael Tam). Prof Tam taught the first half of the course while Prof Zhao taught the tutorials. After the midterm, they switched. There were weekly tutorials and they were mandatory. In the first half of the tutorial, the Prof held a quick review session on the concepts taught in class and in the second half was the weekly quiz. In my personal opinion, the quizzes were a good reflection on the material taught in class and forced you to study in order to do well in them. This course also had a lab component that was held by a different professor (Professor Jeff Gostik). This was one of the worst labs I have ever taken. The labs were a mess and were very random. We started off learning how to use excel and write lab reports. It was in this course that I learned the importance of word automation, citation management, and figure/diagram creation. Although this was useful, it had little to no connection to Chemical Engineering which was very surprising for a first year chemical engineering core course. He then had us learn how to use AutoCad PID (A software for creating Piping instrumentation diagram. The task was to replicate the piping diagram for the liquid nitrogen tank system outside of E6) He wanted a PID diagram which none of us knew what they were and how to even create one. The funny thing is that Jeff Gostik doesnâ€™t even know how to use the program, yet he expects first years to learn how to use the software and connect the pipes with the correct valves and other equipment in 1 week time. I know many students ditched the AutoCad software and just used Microsoft Paint to create them. We then moved onto learning very basic python which he struggled teaching as well. This lab was so disorganized and so random that I barely learned anything from it. I have heard from some first years currently that there is a new curriculum and it has improved a lot. I am hoping it is better for the future students.'},
