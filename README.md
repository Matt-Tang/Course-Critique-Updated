The purpose of this website is to allow other students to read my accomplisments and struggles as a Waterloo Engineering Student. My course reviews are MY OWN HONEST OPINION. I will aim to provide meaninful insight to those who will take these courses in the future. I hope you
enjoy the read and I will try to update this as frequently as possible.
